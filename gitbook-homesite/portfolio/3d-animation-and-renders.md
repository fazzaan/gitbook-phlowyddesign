# ðŸ§Š 3D animation & renders

I've really only dabbled in this field.&#x20;

But dabbling has given me a little experience, so I'm not just wandering around in the dark.



I made these in April 2022 while exploring Blender for making the underwaterscape in my flyer for [PsyJelly 16 with Halfred and Ekorce](graphic-design-work/event-marketing.md#psyjelly-16-halfred-iacchus-ekorce-5th-birthday-bash).

_For the short animations, they may be loopable; right click on the video and choose "loop" to see it._&#x20;
