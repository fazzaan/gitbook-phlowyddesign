# ðŸ§Š 3D animation & renders

I've really only dabbled in this field.&#x20;

But dabbling has given me a little experience, so I'm not just wandering around in the dark.



I made these in April 2022 while exploring Blender for making the underwaterscape in my flyer for [PsyJelly 16 with Halfred and Ekorce](event-marketing.md#psyjelly-16-halfred-iacchus-ekorce-5th-birthday-bash).

_actually the files are videos and I can't upload them on here so I'll have to put them on vimeo or sth idk_
