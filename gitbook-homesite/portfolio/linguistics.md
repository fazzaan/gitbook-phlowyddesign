# Linguistics

## English teacher, Pronunciation trainer, Book author

* I am an English teacher



* I teach online, with most of my students coming from South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, Brazil, South America and Arabic nations



* I teach in Viet Nam and I speak Vietnamese, so I have lots of experience & knowledge and extensive specific teaching methods tailored to Vietnamese students



* I have self-trained myself in pronunciation skills, with a deep understanding & control of the mouth, and well-tested methods of training students to mindfully control their mouths to pronounce clearly.



* I have written several English study books, which are available to download & print for free or a donation. You can find links to download and to donate below.



## Etymology

* I have a keen interest in etymology
* I view the lexicon of a language as an immutable historical record of the people, culture and land
  * However, this depends on having access to source materials from across the eras, and on those materials evading censorship
* I've studied some of the source languages (or their descendants) of English to a basic level, including: German, Greek, Spanish, Hindi.



## Creative Linguistics

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fun fact**: you can create and use whatever you want in this life, as long as you're not harming others.

**Fun fact 2**: if you create things within rules and parameters, and bend the boundaries gently, you can create things that expand other people's perceptions, perspectives and limits of understanding.

* I create fonts.
* I create [fonts & writing styles](font-design/) that play with the reader's pattern recognition.
* I create scripts (alphabets, orthographic systems, spelling patterns) for writing existing languages.&#x20;
  * Most notable is [NewEng](https://app.gitbook.com/o/bhv2aXe6eExkCxRzuAVK/s/nQuhfcBU5w4vA1rwurTv/), a 41-letter alphabet for modern English, containing phonemic representation, etymology and grammatical morphology.&#x20;
  * Another notable script is NewViet, which I created to represent Vietnamese spelling in a shorter way, without changing the fundamental orthography â€” this is important because, despite protest from nearly everyone, the current script is actually good in that it contains more phonemic distinction than is present in (almost?) any accent, thereby allowing it to serve multiple key accents without loss of phonemic resolution. (I haven't yet published NewViet.)
  * I designed a 2x2 block-based script ([blocktrain.md](font-design/blocktrain.md "mention")) as a commission job for a game developer. The glyphs represent Latin letters, but are entirely different. They also bear phonetic relationships to one another.
  * I've created several others, but usually had no active application for them, so they are lost to the depths of my notebooks.
* I gradually introduce letters and orthographic representation of my scripts to other people, mainly via posts & videos on social media, in an effort to encourage their brains to process language more flexibly.&#x20;
  * This has the domino-effect that eventually results in them being able to interpret new languages more easily.&#x20;
  * This is important because a lot, perhaps the vast majority, of native English speakers in Anglospheric countries, do not learn foreign languages and live in the belief that learning a second language is super hard.
* I create new words on the fly, based on word roots and suffixes. (We all do this sometimes, but it is related to the next point: )
* I create new vocabulary sets and classes, which you can see here: \

* I've come up with a few grammatical constructs for English, usually inspired by other languages like Vietnamese and Korean, but I haven't written them down yet.
