# Abjoid Blocky One

This is a proof-of-concept font, just to model a script that I created. It can be used to type with, but it isn't beautiful and it isn't perfected. It is literally just a model font file to contain the basic glyph shapes and their relationships, via shared glyph elements, anchorings, etc.

You can learn about my conscript _Abjoid_ on my conscripts gitbook website:  <a href="https://lang.gitbook.io/conlangs/creations/abjoid-conscript" class="button primary">Abjoid conscript</a>&#x20;

## Letters

* Abjoid conscript letters: five base consonants, consonant diacritic modifiers to construct a broad array of phonetic sounds.
* Vowels are based on a vowel system attuned to my personal vowel model hypotheses.
* Indirectly supports Latin alphabet and NewEng script orthography with equivalent abjoid letters.
* Can probably support a range of other scripts, but is not tailored for them.
* Can be used to type English, but it's only functional as a cypher, because the Abjoid glyphs represent mouth positions and relative phonemes, whereas Latinate glyphs in English represent a complex (and oft broken) array of sounds and phonetic mutations.

### Diacritics

* _include: Vector image of all glyphs with respective diacritics_



## Numerals

* include:&#x20;
  * Vector image of numerals
  * Vector image of dot-derived numerals



## Sample words

* _include: Vector images of a range of words, specifically ones containing NewEng letters_

To Do


### Further development

* _incomplete aspects of the font_
* _diacritics, etc_
* _maye feature initial and final glyph forms, akin to the Arabic abjad script style._

### Fixes

* _include: bugs â€” glyphic, kerning, diacritics_

### Variants

* Abjoid Latinate One&#x20;
  * My first foray into adapting the Abjoid conscript into Latin-based glyphs, attempting to produce a hybrid script that blends Latin letter shapes and consonant diacritics, enabling NewEng orthographic spelling.&#x20;
  * Abjoid Latinate One also contains a few letter adaptations to respect the letter variants in the English alphabet, such as C-K-Q and the vowel-consonant Y.
* _ideas for typeface variations -- stylistic exploration_
* _ideas for font variations -- weighting methods, serifs, italicization, etc_
