# Abjoid Latinate One

_This is a proof-of-concept font, just to model a script that I created. It can be used to type with, but it isn't beautiful and it isn't perfected. It is literally just a model font file to contain the basic glyph shapes and their relationships, via shared glyph elements, anchorings, etc._

This script is a hybrid script that uses the script construction of Abjoid and the Latinate letter shapes for the five base consonants. Its fundament is identical to Abjoid, but the appearance is so dramatically different that it is almost another script in itself.

You can learn about my conscript _Abjoid_ on my conscripts gitbook website:  <a href="https://lang.gitbook.io/conlangs/creations/abjoid-conscript" class="button primary">Abjoid conscript</a>&#x20;

## About Abjoid Latinate conscript

* Letters: five base consonants, consonant diacritic modifiers to construct many phonetic sounds.
* Vowels are based on a vowel system attuned to [my personal vowel model hypotheses](https://lang.gitbook.io/en/pronunciation-mastery/sound-system/vowel-series/vowel-model-v3).
* Indirectly supports Latin alphabet and NewEng script orthography with equivalent abjoid letters.
* Can probably support a range of other scripts, but is not tailored for them.
* Can be used to type English, but it's only functional as a cypher, because the Abjoid glyphs represent mouth positions and relative phonemes, whereas Latinate glyphs in English represent a complex (and oft broken) array of sounds and phonetic mutations.

### Letters

For Abjoid Latinate conscript, the five base phone letters are mapped as such:

<table><thead><tr><th width="199">Position</th><th width="103" align="center">Abjoid glyph</th><th width="109" align="center">Latinate glyph</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>lip</em></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Foundation - Lip base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Latinate - P base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> — P</td></tr><tr><td><em>behind upper teeth</em></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Foundation - Upper teeth base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Latinate - T base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> — T</td></tr><tr><td><em>behind lower teeth</em></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Foundation - Lower teeth base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Latinate - S base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> — S</td></tr><tr><td><em>palate</em></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Foundation - Palate base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Latinate - C base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> — <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-2">C</a></td></tr><tr><td><em>velum</em></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Foundation - Velum base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"></td><td align="center"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Abjoid Latinate - K base.svg" alt="" data-size="line"> — K </td></tr></tbody></table>

### Diacritics

The diacritic modifiers follow the basic shapes of the modifiers in the Abjoid foundation conscript, but have been drawn in such a way as to be writable within one pen stroke with the letter if possible, and to provide a visually distinctive shape so that the reader can discern the letter and word more quickly:

<table><thead><tr><th width="192">Quality</th><th width="216">Diacritic</th><th width="92" align="center"></th><th width="239">Abjoid foundation diacritic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Unaspirated, unvoiced</em></td><td>None</td><td align="center"></td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><em>Aspirated</em></td><td>Line above, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Dot above</td></tr><tr><td><em>Voiced</em></td><td>Loop below, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Dot below</td></tr><tr><td><em>Aspirated &#x26; voiced</em></td><td>Loops above and below, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Dots above and below</td></tr><tr><td><em>Fricative, unvoiced</em></td><td>Circumflex above, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Circumflex above</td></tr><tr><td><em>Fricative, voiced</em></td><td>Caron below, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Caron below</td></tr><tr><td><em>Nasal</em></td><td>Ring above, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Ring above</td></tr><tr><td><em>Breath</em></td><td>Ring below, joined</td><td align="center"></td><td>Ring below</td></tr><tr><td><em>Glide</em></td><td>Dome above</td><td align="center"></td><td>Three dots above</td></tr><tr><td><em>Breathed glide</em></td><td>Dome above, ring below</td><td align="center"></td><td>Three dots above, ring below</td></tr><tr><td><em>Silenced letter</em></td><td>Grave above</td><td align="center"></td><td>Grave above</td></tr></tbody></table>

### English Alphabet glyphs

To write the English and NewEng alphabet orthographies, customised letters have been created, not dissimilar to how some hanzi/kanji are created. The base glyph is the phonetic glyph from Abjoid, and upon it is marked some kind of shape reminiscent of the English letter that it represents. This is for prreservation of spellings for etymology and phonemic mutation.&#x20;

Main examples are C, Ç, K, Ʞ and Q:&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="263" valign="top">Letter</th><th width="70"></th><th valign="top">Abjoid modification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><strong>K</strong> is always /k/, and is sometimes silenced, K̀.</td><td></td><td valign="top">The Latinate base glyph is actually K-shaped. K is also the only phonetically-stable glyph, so this base glyph is unmodified for English.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Ʞ</strong> is primarily /k/, but may be smudged into /ʃ/ in words entering via French, spelled as Ʞ̇.</td><td></td><td valign="top">Ʞ in the NewEng glyph block is a rotated K. A diacritiqued version for /ʃ/ is being drafted.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Q</strong> is always /k/, but goes with ⟨U⟩ because of vowel positioning (it descends from Ancient Greek's letter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koppa_(letter)"><em>qoppa</em></a>, Ϙ, ϙ).</td><td></td><td valign="top">Q in the English glyph block is a K glyph with a Q-like hook tail, visually akin to Q and q.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>C</strong> is /k/ as ⟨ca⟩, ⟨co⟩, ⟨cu⟩; but C is /s/ as ⟨ce⟩, ⟨ci⟩, ⟨cy⟩, and often undergoes assimilation when the e, i or y is proceeded by another vowel. These sound mutations are at least as old as Latin.</td><td></td><td valign="top">C in the English glyph block is a K glyph with a small C-shaped hook at the start of the line to indicate its difference. This allows readers to understand that the spelling is a C but the pronunciation may become a /s/ (or similar) if standard English orthographic spelling applies.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><strong>Ç</strong> is always /s/, and Ç̇ is /ʃ/</td><td></td><td valign="top">This letter has not yet been designed in Abjoid. Most likely, it will be a /s/ sounding glyph with a C-shaped hook modifier, akin to the modified K.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Another good example is Y, which functions as a glide consonant in onset position, a vowel in medial positions, a closing diphthong in codas and some medial positions, and both a closing diphthong and glide consonant in vowel-medial positions. It is one of the craziest letters, actually.

Despite all these variations, we can reduce it to two basic functions:

1. Y as a consonant, /j/ — you, yes, yellow, young
2. Y as a vowel,&#x20;
   1. /ɪj/ — happy, funny, easy
   2. /ɑj/ — by, my, fly, cry, dry, hyper[^3]

Y as a consonant is the default value of the Y glyph in the English glyphset of Abjoid Latinate, a palatal base glyph marked with a glide diacritic modifier:

_<mark style="color:red;">**Y consonant glyph vector here**</mark>_

Y as a vowel is the secondary value of Y and is marked with an /ɪj/ vowel inside the base Y glyph.

_<mark style="color:red;">**Y vowel glyph vector here**</mark>_

_Other letters may need consideration as I develop this conscript further._

To Do


### Further development

* Vowels are currently identical to those in Abjoid base script, which is not a problem but isn't in keeping with the Abjoid Latinate conscript concept. This font was made in a rush just as a proof of concept so that I didn't lose the idea while working on another client's project.
* _incomplete aspects of the font_
* _diacritics, etc_
* _maybe feature initial and final glyph forms, akin to the Arabic abjad script style._

### Fixes

* _include: bugs — glyphic, kerning, diacritics_
* bug: the nasal marker and one of the other under-markers look too similar. Consider reforming the one that isn't the nasal marker.

### Variants

* Abjoid Latinate One&#x20;
  * My first foray into adapting the Abjoid conscript into Latin-based glyphs, attempting to produce a hybrid script that blends Latin letter shapes and consonant diacritics, enabling NewEng orthographic spelling.&#x20;
  * Abjoid Latinate One also contains a few letter adaptations to respect the letter variants in the English alphabet, such as C-K-Q and the vowel-consonant Y.
* _ideas for typeface variations -- stylistic exploration_
* _ideas for font variations -- weighting methods, serifs, italicization, etc_

[^1]: Private Use Area

[^2]: Arguably this might be better on a J glyph base, considering that C is burned into most people's brains as a /k/ and /s/.

[^3]: Technically /hɑjpɚ/ is a (lol) hypercorrectionism, as the ⟨y⟩ is representative of Greek's ypsilon, pronounced /y/, close to the sound /i/. Thus, hyper should be pronounced /hɪjpɚ/. But it's not so never mind
