# ✒️ Scripts & Alphabets

Some are just teeny ideas

Some are modifications of English and Latin

Some are made to look like other scripts, essentially are just fonts but borrow some orthographic ideas

Some are full-blown new imaginings of how to represent sounds, demonstrating phonic relationships, either just with patterned marks, or featurally — attempting to represent the mouth in some way.

## NewEng Orthography

This is my most well-developed script so far.

It is all-encompassing and, thus far, seemingly bug-free.

It copes with the entirety of modern English, preserving thrōth[^1] etymology _**and**_ pronunciation _**and**_ grammatical spelling morphology (like -ed, -s/es, etc.).

> _Please note that there is another script by the same name. I came up with this (very uninspired) name by myself, and intend to rename it, but at this time I haven't thought of a new name._

Here is the full 41-letter alphabet:

<mark style="color:blue;">A Æ B C Ç D E F Φ Þ Đ G Ȝ H Ƕ I J K Ʞ L M N И Ŋ O Œ P Q R S Ʃ T Ч U Ȣ V W Ꝏ X Y Z</mark>

<mark style="color:blue;">a æ b c ç d e f φ þ ð g ȝ h ƕ i j k ʞ l m n и ŋ o œ p q r s ʃ t ч u ȣ v w ꝏ x y z</mark>

I may replace Latin Double-O with Cyrillic Omega **Ѡ ѡ** in the near future. It is rarely used in modern Cyrillic languages, but it gets much better treatment in modern fonts than Double-O, with decent diacritic anchoring in several major fonts.

## Abjoid Conscript

This conscript came to mind presumably inspired by the Arabic abjad script, but I have to say that I really wasn't thinking about Arabic at the time! It looks somewhat similar in shape and style and concept, and it came to me soon after I started attempting to study the abjad.

Following in nomenclaturic tradition, I've named my conscript _Abjoid_, the -oid suffix for "similar in form".

Abjoid is fairly simple to learn to read and write, but it can take a bit of time to get used to processing it while reading it. However, I've made an effort to visually distinguish the diacritics clearly, and the base consonants are obviously different from one another.

Abjoid consists of 5 base consonants and a variety of diacritics, some of which can combine to form complex sounds. There are also several vowels (4 bases which can combine to form variations and diphthongs) and a rhoticisation marker (which is separate from the glyph for R as a real sound).

The 5 base consonants represent 5 key positions in the mouth, which I have observed is a common amount of distinct mouth positions used in many languages.

The diacritics, marked above and/or below the base consonant, indicates the method of pronouncing the sound. In this way, the resultant consonantal letter is an instructional glyph, providing both the mouth position and sound method for pronouncing it.

### Abjoid Latinate

I have also made a Latin-letter-based variant of the Abjoid script, which is visually so completely different that it practically constitutes a different script — although, the fundament is identical, the glyphs represent the same things, and the way to type is the same. (A direct analogy for understanding this is considering the various languages which have multiple scripts with one-to-one spelling parity.)

At present, both the _Abjoid_ and _Abjoid Latinate_ conscript fonts mainly exist as proofs-of-concept, because — like all fun things — they came to me while I was super busy in the middle of doing another job for a client, so I had to smash them out quickly so as to record them well enough to not forget the ideas. When I have time soon, I'll experiment further with them, and if I still enjoy using them, I'll make some cleaner and more stylish fonts for both the Latinate form and Abjoid proper.

### AbjAng Orthography

As with all writing systems, a script still needs an orthography. An orthography is essentially the way that the script is used to represent the concepts within the language, typically sounds but sometimes ideas too. The AbjAng Orthography is based upon my own NewEng Orthography, because that is a lossless orthography for English which retains both spelling patterns and etymological roots, and is non-ambiguous in reading (one sound may be represented by several letters, but one letter always only represents one sound).

## Dot-derived Numerals

In bits and pieces, I've experimented with various ways of depicting numerical values.

Once I accidentally discovered a way to derive our modern numerals from dots. I don't know if this is how they originated, but it works surprisingly well.

* _include derivation here (photo sent to Ryan)_

During the process of script development for a commission job, I derived new numerals for the script using the same dot-based approach. The result was a series of number glyphs which I actually prefer over our own current glyphs — they are dyslexia-friendly, non-ambiguous shapes, and extend to dozenal's 9+1 and 9+2 glyphs, still drawable with a singular unbroken line.

I intend to extend my typeface catalogue with these numerals, contained as alternate numeral glyphs.

* _include vector image of new numerals in a few typefaces_
* _include link to dedicated page if I create one. Perhaps on my linguistics gitbook site._

[^1]: "both" but for three things. i made this word; you're welcome.

    _Inspired by "cả" of Vietnamese, which allows group selection of more than 2 items:_

    * _"both" is "cả hai"_
    * _"þrōþ" is "cả ba"_

    _This can be extended to any number._
