# ✒️ Scripts & Alphabets

Some are just teeny ideas

Some are modifications of English and Latin

Some are made to look like other scripts, essentially are just fonts but borrow some orthographic ideas

Some are full-blown new imaginings of how to represent sounds, demonstrating phonic relationships, either just with patterned marks, or featurally — attempting to represent the mouth in some way.



## NewEng Orthography

This is my most well-developed script so far.

It is all-encompassing and, thus far, seemingly bug-free.

It copes with the entirety of modern English, preserving thrōth[^1] etymology _**and**_ pronunciation _**and**_ grammatical spelling morphology (like -ed, -s/es, etc.).&#x20;

> _Please note that there is another script by the same name. I came up with this (very uninspired) name by myself, and intend to rename it, but at this time I haven't thought of a new name._

You can learn more about NewEng on my dedicated website:

## Dot-derived Numerals

In bits and pieces, I've experimented with various ways of depicting numerical values.

Once I accidentally discovered a way to derive our modern numerals from dots. I don't know if this is how they originated, but it works surprisingly well.

* _include derivation here (photo sent to Ryan)_

During the process of script development for a commission job, I derived new numerals for the script using the same dot-based approach. The result was a series of number glyphs which I actually prefer over our own current glyphs — they are dyslexia-friendly, non-ambiguous shapes, and extend to dozenal's 9+1 and 9+2 glyphs, still drawable with a singular unbroken line.

I intend to extend my typeface catalogue with these numerals, contained as alternate numeral glyphs.

* _include vector image of new numerals in a few typefaces_



* _include link to dedicated page if I create one. Perhaps on my linguistics gitbook site._



[^1]: "both" but for three things. i made this word; you're welcome.



    _Inspired by "cả" of Vietnamese, which allows group selection of more than 2 items:_&#x20;

    * _"both" is "cả hai"_&#x20;
    * _"þrōþ" is "cả ba"_

    _This can be extended to any number._
