# Scripts & Alphabets

Some are just teeny ideas

Some are modifications of English and Latin

Some are made to look like other scripts, essentially are just fonts but borrow some orthographic ideas

Some are full-blown new imaginings of how to represent sounds, demonstrating phonic relationships, either just with patterned marks, or featurally â€” attempting to represent the mouth in some way.
