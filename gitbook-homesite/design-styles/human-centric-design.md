# Human-Centric Design

_<mark style="color:orange;">not the life guidance model</mark>_



Design considering human users first.

### Make UI predictable:&#x20;

* repeated layouts,&#x20;
* same type of functions,&#x20;
* clicking the same link/button in multiple locations/positions/contexts should still result in the same outcome. E.g. if it opens a new tab/panel in one context, _**it should do the same in any other context.**_
* major interaction types — e.g. back, confirm, cancel — should inhabit regular positions, and should not move, and especially should not switch with each other.
* all buttons should be visible at any UI dimension, or at least discoverable inside an obvious menu.
* all useful UI features should be present at any UI dimension.

### Make UI stable.

* buttons should not fucking slide around the screen when you're trying to click on them
* buttons for mode toggles — e.g. screen changes, panels, etc — should be in the same position with the mode active and inactive.&#x20;

### Make UX respect the user's purpose:

* a music app should NEVER\*[^1] use audio cues for things like errors, especially basic errors like clicking outside of a popup window/menu
