# Photoshop

Adobe is a bit rude when it comes to respecting users.

Goodness knows what happened to them but whatever.

You should check a few settings in your new Photoshop installation, for optimising its performance and also protecting your system from getting damaged. Yes, Photoshop's default settings can actually _damage_ your computer.

Settings to configure:

* Scratch disk usage — _**most important**_&#x20;
* Memory usage&#x20;
* GPU usage&#x20;
* Old rendering method&#x20;

How to get to Photoshop's settings:

* `Ctrl+,` or is it `Ctrl+K` ?&#x20;
* File → Preferences → All&#x20;
* The categories are expanded in the submenu, and are visible down the left side of the window.



## Scratch disk usage — _**most important**_

The _scratch disk_ is the space where Photoshop stores temporary data while you are editing your images. I suppose it's a bit like extended RAM (memory) space, but stored on the computer's hard disk (storage — SSD, HDD) so that it doesn't get lost if the computer loses power.&#x20;

I'm not super clear on the hows and whys of the scratch disk, but what I _do_ know is that it involves a lot of reading, writing, overwriting and deleting. Any digital storage device is _**still a physical object**_ and so it suffers from degradation through usage and time. The more that one part of a disk gets used, the faster it degrades — and SSDs are prone to faster degradation, due to their nature.&#x20;

If you want your SSD to last a long time, try to put Photoshop's scratch disk space on a secondary disk. Using a HDD will be noticeably slower, so if you have a second SSD (of lesser importance — smaller, older, cheaper, lower-grade tech), use that for scratch disk space instead.

## Memory usage

Photoshop's RAM[^1] allowance can be configured, too. For some reason, it still uses _more_ than you set in the preferences, but it's close to the value you set, so you do have some control over it. I assume this means that the usage is only limited for graphical processing, and does not include the RAM used by the application itself.&#x20;

## GPU usage

## Old rendering method

[^1]: Random Access Memory.&#x20;



    Do not confuse this with _storage memory_ (SSD, HDD, flash etc), which often gets erroneously abbreviated to _memory_.
